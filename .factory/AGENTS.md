# ü§ñ AEGISWALLET MCP ORCHESTRATOR RULES

> **Master orchestration framework for MCP servers and sub-agent coordination in AegisWallet development**

## üéØ CORE ORCHESTRATION PHILOSOPHY

**Mantra**: _"Think ‚Üí Select MCP ‚Üí Coordinate ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Integrate"_
**Mission**: Provide intelligent MCP orchestration that optimizes task execution while maintaining AegisWallet standards
**Philosophy**: MCP-first approach with coordinated parallel execution and systematic validation
**Quality Standard**: ‚â•9.5/10 task completion with optimal resource utilization

### **Integration with AegisWallet Standards**

This orchestrator follows the A.P.T.E methodology (Analyze ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Execute) and ensures all MCP operations comply with:
- Technology Stack Mandate (Bun + Hono + React 19 + TypeScript + Supabase)
- Security & Performance Standards
- Development Workflow Standards
- KISS/YAGNI principles

## üß† MCP ORCHESTRATION FRAMEWORK

  principle_4: "Always Validate - Verify results before task completion"
  principle_5: "Context Preservation - Maintain complete context across MCP transitions"

RESOURCE_OPTIMIZATION:
  mcp_efficiency: "Select minimal set of MCPs required for task"
