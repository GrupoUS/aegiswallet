# Command: /research | /pesquisar

## Universal Description

**APEX-RESEARCHER POWERED Research System** - Multi-MCP orchestration with apex-researcher droid delivering ≥95% cross-validation accuracy through Context7, Tavily, Serena, and Sequential Thinking integration.

## Purpose

Execute comprehensive research operations through apex-researcher droid with automatic MCP orchestration for authoritative multi-source validation and actionable intelligence.

## Automatic Apex-Researcher Routing

```yaml
command_execution:
  trigger: "/research | /pesquisar"
  routing: "Task(apex-researcher) - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY"
  bypass_implementation: "TRUE - apex-researcher NEVER implements"
  
input_parsing:
  goal: "Extract from research objective description"
  scope: "Technology, domain, or regulatory area" 
  complexity: "L1-L10 research depth assessment"
  brazilian_focus: "LGPD/BCB/PIX requirements auto-detection"

quality_assurance:
  accuracy_threshold: "≥95% cross-validation required"
  source_authority: "Official documentation + community validation"
  confidence_levels: "Explicit confidence scoring on all findings"
```

## Context Detection & MCP Routing

- **Research Operations**: Topic investigation, technology evaluation → Context7 + Tavily
- **Knowledge Management**: Knowledge base creation, organization → Serena + Sequential Thinking  
- **Intelligence Synthesis**: Multi-source validation → All MCPs parallel
- **Brazilian Compliance**: LGPD/BCB/PIX research → Tavily + Context7 + Sequential Thinking
- **Technology Research**: Framework comparison, patterns → Context7 + Tavily

## MCP Serena: Codebase Intelligence

### Core Capabilities
- **Symbol Resolution**: `find_symbol` - Function/class/interface discovery
- **Reference Analysis**: `find_referencing_symbols` - Code relationships mapping
- **Pattern Search**: `search_for_pattern` - Implementation pattern discovery
- **Code Overview**: `get_symbols_overview` - High-level code structure analysis

### Usage Patterns
```yaml
code_analysis:
  symbol_resolution: "Function/class/interface discovery"
  pattern_analysis: "Existing implementation patterns"
  dependency_mapping: "Code relationships + imports"
  architecture_insights: "Current system structure"

implementation_feasibility:
  compatibility_check: "Integration with existing codebase"
  pattern_alignment: "Consistency with current architecture"
  effort_estimation: "Implementation complexity assessment"
```

### Memory Management
- Creates persistent knowledge memories for project insights
- Stores architectural patterns and implementation decisions
- Enables cross-session context preservation
- Supports research-to-implementation knowledge transfer

## MCP Orchestration Workflow

### Multi-MCP Execution Strategy
```yaml
parallel_execution:
  phase_1_discovery:
    context7: "Official documentation + API references"
    tavily: "Web research + community validation"
    serena: "Codebase analysis + symbol resolution"
    
  phase_2_analysis:
    sequential_thinking: "Multi-perspective synthesis + logical reasoning"
    context7: "Deep dive into technical specifics"
    tavily: "Cross-source verification + credibility assessment"
    
  phase_3_validation:
    serena: "Implementation feasibility analysis"
    sequential_thinking: "Pattern recognition + gap identification"
    all_mcps: "Cross-validation for ≥95% accuracy"
```
