# Assistente Financeiro Aut√¥nomo - UI/UX Design Specifications

## Project Overview

This is the comprehensive UI/UX design specification for "Assistente Financeiro Aut√¥nomo," a revolutionary voice-first financial assistant designed specifically for the Brazilian market. The system combines 95% automation with intuitive voice commands, making financial management effortless through intelligent AI assistance.

## Design Philosophy

**GPS Financeiro + Smart Home Metaphor**: Users navigate their financial landscape with an AI assistant that anticipates needs and manages autonomously, similar to a smart home system that learns and adapts.
