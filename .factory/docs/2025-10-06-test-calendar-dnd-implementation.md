# Plan to Test Calendar DnD Implementation

## Background
The calendar drag-and-drop functionality was failing with "useDndMonitor must be used within a children of <DndContext>" error. A CalendarDndProvider has been created following the reference implementation pattern to fix this issue.

## Implementation Status
✅ CalendarDndProvider component created with proper DnD context management
✅ EventCalendar component updated to use provider pattern
✅ Unused imports and constants cleaned up
✅ Provider includes sensor configuration and drag overlay

## Testing Plan

### 1. Start Development Server
- Run `bun dev` to start the development server
- Check for any compilation errors

### 2. Navigate to Calendar Page
- Access the calendar feature in the application
- Verify the page loads without the useDndMonitor error
- Check browser console for any errors

### 3. Test Drag-and-Drop Functionality
- Create test events on the calendar if needed
- Attempt to drag events to different time slots
- Verify events can be rescheduled via drag-and-drop
- Check that visual overlay appears during dragging

### 4. Validate Event Updates
- Confirm that dragged events maintain their duration
- Verify that event data is properly updated after drag operations
- Test edge cases (dragging to same time, invalid positions)

### 5. Quality Assurance
- Check TypeScript compilation for any errors
- Verify the implementation follows KISS/YAGNI principles
- Ensure no unused imports or dead code remain

This testing will validate that the calendar DnD implementation works correctly and the original error has been resolved.
